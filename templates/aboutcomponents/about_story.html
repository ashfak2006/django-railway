            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Founded in 2010 by fashion enthusiast Isabella Martinez, our boutique began as a small corner shop in downtown San Francisco with a simple mission: to provide unique, high-quality fashion that empowers individuals to express their authentic selves.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">What started as a passion project quickly blossomed into a beloved destination for fashion-forward individuals seeking curated collections that stand apart from mass-market offerings. Our dedication to personal service and thoughtful curation has remained unchanged even as we've grown.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Today, we're proud to serve customers worldwide through our online store while maintaining the personal touch and attention to detail that defined our humble beginnings. Every item in our collection is carefully selected to ensure quality, sustainability, and timeless style.</p>
